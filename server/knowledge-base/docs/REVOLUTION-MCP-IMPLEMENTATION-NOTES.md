# Revolution MCP Server Implementation Log

**Last updated:** 2025-09-30

## 2025-09-30
- Initialized `server/` TypeScript project targeting Node 20 with MCP SDK dependencies.
- Implemented stdio-based entry point (`src/index.ts`) that loads configuration, resolves the knowledge base path, and connects the MCP server.
- Added placeholder tooling infrastructure:
  - `registerTools` scaffolding with a development `revolution__ping` tool.
  - Catalog loader stub to verify knowledge base accessibility.
  - Flow Nexus adapter stub referencing the `revolution` namespace configuration.
- Added Winston-based logger for consistent startup and error reporting.
- Established npm scripts for build/dev and documented configuration environment variables.

- Added smoke test covering config loading, catalog stub, Flow Nexus adapter stub, and ping tool registration.
- `npm test` verifies the server scaffolding executes without runtime errors.
- Implemented catalog ingestion pipeline indexing docs, organizing guides, analysis, and PDF sources with metadata.
- Updated smoke test to assert catalog content and ensure ingestion operates against the real corpus.

- Parsed Flow Nexus memory keys from `docs/MEMORY-STRUCTURE-GUIDE.md` and exposed metadata/highlights via the adapter.
- Updated smoke test to validate 19 memory keys are available for tooling.

- Implemented MCP memory tools (`revolution__list_memory_keys`, `revolution__get_memory_key`) backed by parsed highlights.
- Centralized server state hydration and updated smoke tests to cover tool registry plus list/get outputs (now run via `tsx`).

- Introduced `revolution__search_documents` theory tool delivering query-based snippets from the markdown corpus.
- Expanded smoke test to exercise document search alongside memory tooling.

- Introduced `revolution__query_theory` tool synthesizing answers with citation payloads.
- Document search now feeds both snippet retrieval and theory synthesis; smoke tests cover query output confidence.

- Added citation metadata across memory and document tools with smoke tests verifying citation presence.

- Stubbed vector index interface and integrated noop hybrid retrieval fallback for theory tools.

*Next focus: enhance theory synthesis using vector scores and optimize hybrid retrieval heuristics.*
