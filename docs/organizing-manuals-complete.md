# 1. COMMUNITY ORGANIZING HANDBOOK: BASE-BUILDING STRATEGIES

## I. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Historical Materialist Approach to Community Organizing
Based on Marx's analysis of class struggle and Lenin's understanding of revolutionary organization:

**Core Principles:**
- **Material Conditions First**: Address immediate needs while building revolutionary consciousness
- **Dialectical Development**: Organize around contradictions between community needs and system failures
- **Class Unity**: Build solidarity across racial and ethnic lines through shared material interests
- **Revolutionary Consciousness**: Connect immediate struggles to broader systemic transformation

**From Liberation Theology (Guti√©rrez)**:
- **Preferential Option for the Poor**: Center organizing on most marginalized community members
- **See-Judge-Act Method**: Analyze conditions, make moral judgment, take collective action
- **Base Communities**: Small democratic groups combining analysis, education, and action

### Goldman's Anarchist Principles in Community Work
- **Individual Liberation within Collective**: Honor personal autonomy while building collective power
- **Direct Action**: Confront power directly rather than relying on intermediaries
- **Voluntary Association**: Build cooperation without coercive hierarchy
- **Prefigurative Politics**: Embody the values of the society we want to create
