**Public Comment Template:**

RE: [Policy/Ordinance Number and Title]

My name is [name] and I am a resident of [location]. I am writing to oppose [specific policy] because:

1. TIMING CONCERNS: This policy is being rushed through during a crisis when community input is limited and people are focused on immediate survival needs.

2. EXPLOITATION CONCERNS: This policy appears to benefit [corporations/entities] while harming [community groups] who are already struggling with crisis impacts.

3. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY: The community has not had adequate opportunity to review and respond to this significant policy change.

4. ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS: Instead of [proposed policy], our community needs [community-driven alternatives].

I urge you to:
- Delay this decision until normal public input processes can resume
- Require community impact assessments
- Prioritize community recovery over corporate interests
- Support [specific alternative policy]

Thank you for considering the voices of community members who will be most affected by this decision.
